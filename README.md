#i-am-a-skid

The purpose of this script is simple: **To eliminate skids everywhere!!**
All jokes aside, i-am-a-skid is a little thing that helps you shape your
Google searches so that you can reach the information you need without
posting a redundant question and getting roasted on the Internet. That's
all.

#Installation

You'll need to have Node.js to install this. If you don't know what it is,
it's basically a cool thing that runs Javascript in your command
prompt/terminal. Head to https://nodejs.org and download it. Afterwards,
you'll be able to install with the following command:

>	npm install -g i-am-a-skid

#Usage

Simply run `i-am-a-skid`. You can use the --language switch to specify
a language beforehand. Otherwise, the program will ask you which
language you seek help with. Next, you will be asked what your end goal
is. Based on this information, a Google search query will be generated
and opened in your browser. Bam.
